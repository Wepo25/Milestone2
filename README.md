# Project Machine learning Classification Symbols

In this paper, we present our approach to classify handwritten mathematical symbols using various machine
learning techniques. Our work is based on a course project for the CS-233(b) Introduction to Machine Learning
at the EPFL. We implemented and evaluated various machine learning methods on a subset of the HASYv2
dataset, which consists of small 32x32 images of hand-drawn mathematical symbols. The three methods used in
our study are MLP, CNNs and PCA. We evaluated the performance of these models using accuracy and F1-score
as evaluation metrics.
